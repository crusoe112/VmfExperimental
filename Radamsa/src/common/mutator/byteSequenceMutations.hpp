 * @brief This module is draws heavily upon the libAFL mutator.c
 * 
 * Uses the specified AFL-style mutation algorithm to mutate the provided
 * input.  createTestCase is the main mutation method.
 *
 * See https://github.com/AFLplusplus/LibAFL-legacy/blob/dev/src/mutator.c

 * The following includes code copied from the LibAFL_Legacy repository.
