== Overview

This document gives an overview of the SamplePackage extension package for VMF.

This sample shows how to write a VMF mutator module.  You can put multiple VMF modules into
a single shared library.

The module here doesn't do anything useful.  It just shows how to set up your build process to
integrate with VMF.
